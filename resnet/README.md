# ResNet

This project implements a **ResNet** from scratch in PyTorch and tests its ability to classify CIFAR-10 and some denoising tasks

**Reference Paper:**  
[Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (He et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

**Notes**  
ResNet is basically convolutional blocks with skip connections.  
In the paper, it ends with flattening and a fully connected layer to output the class scores,  
which works since I'm just doing classification here.

This makes sense for classification tasks, so Iâ€™ll just stick to that for now.

Reading page 4 of the paper gives me the architecture needed for the blocks.  
I'm going with the **34-layer residual network** from the paper.
